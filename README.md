This is a dice roller module for Ruby, intended to support a wide variety of various role-playing games. Currently, this is in a very simple state (only rolling one dice at a time), but more will come, including a pre-made CLI interface.

## Installation

The installation of this gem is pretty standard:

    gem install rpg_dice_roller

If intending to integrate into a project using Bundler, add this module to your project's Gemfile using:

    gem 'rpg_dice_roller'

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Features

Currently only supports simple dice rolls.

### Planned:
  * Multiple dice rolled at once
  * Fudge dice
  * CLI program
  * Hit confirmation
  * And whatever comes to mind afterwards
